# SSH-into-my-EC2-instance-using-terraform
This project uses Terraform to deploy an EC2 instance and enable SSH access. It creates a VPC, subnet, and security group, then launches an instance with a generated key pair. The configuration outputs the instance's public IP and SSH command, allowing secure access.
